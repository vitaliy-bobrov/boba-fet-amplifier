# Boba Fett Amplifier

Boba Fett Amplifier is a discontinued Bossâ„¢ FA-1 FET Amplified in a pedal format. The pedal could be used as a preamp/boost to drive your amp or as a standalone overdrive in the additional mode I added. Overdrive mode enables asymmetrical soft clipping (Tube Screamer style) with 3 LEDs.
